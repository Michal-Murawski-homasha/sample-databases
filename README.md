# Sample Data Base

## Hotel Manager
Hotel Manager is the first sample database, modeled on Sakila, among others, designed to help you learn SQL.
There are separate scripts for MySQL and PostgreSQL to create tables and common scripts to feed the database with data in Polish or English.
For PostgreSQL, before loading the hotel_manager_schema_postgresql.sql file (which creates the tables), first create a database, e.g. in pgAdmin.
For MySQL, just load the hotel_manager_schema_mysql.sql file (in phpmyadmin you don't need to disable foreign key checking).
